## Inspiration:
I was inspired to create the **Brain Tumor Classification model** because I wanted to use technology to make a **positive impact on people's lives**. I learned that early detection of brain tumors is crucial for better treatment outcomes, and I wanted to develop a tool that could **help doctors diagnose tumors more accurately and quickly**.

## What it does:
My Brain Tumor Classification model can analyze medical images of the brain, specifically MRIs, and **determine whether a certain type of tumor (pituitary, glioma, and meningioma) is present or not**. I use algorithms to make these predictions, which can assist doctors in making more informed decisions about a patient's diagnosis.

## How I built it:
I built my Brain Tumor Classification model by sourcing a large dataset of brain images with and without tumors, labeled by type. Then, I used python and data libraries like **opencv, numpy, and matplotlib** to teach my model to recognize the differences between them. I spent many hours training and testing the model to make sure it was as accurate as possible.

## Challenges I ran into:
One of the biggest challenges I faced was finding a large and diverse dataset to train my model effectively. I also had to overcome technical issues, some of which I am still trying to solve and improve. I would like to ensure that my model is reliable enough for medical use.

## Accomplishments that I'm proud of:
I'm proud that my model achieved high accuracy (around **85%**) in detecting brain tumors. It can help doctors make quicker diagnoses and improve patient outcomes. I'm also proud of my dedication in overcoming challenges throughout the project.

## What I learned:
Throughout this hackathon project, I learned about the importance of data, algorithms, and teamwork in building machine learning models. I gained a deeper understanding of how AI can be used for medical purposes and its potential to save lives.

## What's next for Brain Tumor Classification:
In the future, I plan to refine my model further and make it accessible to healthcare providers worldwide. I aim to collaborate with medical professionals to ensure it meets their needs and to explore the possibility of extending the modelâ€™s reach to detect more types of brain tumors. Ultimately, I hope to contribute to better healthcare and save lives through the power of AI.
